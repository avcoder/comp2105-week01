# Why animate?

- Have you ever felt jarred when doing multiple tasks - mind's focus?
- context shifting

# Sarah Drasner = guru

- Show Drasner's quote
- Could you Imagine using your smartphone with no animations? Would you buy another phone that could do animations?
- click link to show article - show map morph example
- when you see it you're not context shifting - 1 delightful flow - successful animation

# Show Val's quote

- subtle vs overanimate
- delightful experience but don't overdo it
- Val asks herself 3 questions before she decides to animate.
- 1st Q: does it tell the user info/something? Hey you're about to do something. If you hover over a button?
- 2nd Q: if you are hovering over button, you are the cause of that change
- 3rd Q: should be response of delight and not frustration
- else leave it out
- click link to show article - show list to add/remove
- the animation is offering the user no context shifting - your brain doesnt have to work hard to cognitively to put in the effort to figure out what happened. Imagine if there was no animation, your brain would have to figure out what happened -- but that's what you want to avoid. UX has to be smooth.

# Peer rev

- when this article came out, it proved that animation should be used
- MS Windows didn't care for it / hushed - didn't want to put in the effort for animation on Win platform vs. Apple did
- now Apple more dominant - success due to iPhone

# Todo Today

- 1. analogy: Karate kid movie (wax off, learning?, test)
- no coding today
- 12 principles = vocabulary - way to express to devs how you want dropdown menus to animate
- keep in mind, was created by Disney decades ago, no Internet, created for different medium - but principles remain
- some apply more to web more than others

# Val's quote:

- learn the vocabulary

# Show 12 Principles youtube video

# Review 1. squash and stretch

- read descriptions for both Q + A slides
- notice I've included a Disney animation that uses that feature
- observe their legs being stretched vs hug their bodies squashed

# Review 2. anticipation

- notice how rabbit before it runs - backwards thing to let you know it's about to do something
- if you're about to jump, you bend down
- think about a website and you hovered over something which gives you info about what it's about to do

# Review 3. staging

- 2 examples
- turtle: background camera angle - you know what's happening. Imagine if background wasn't there

# Review 4. pose to pose vs straight ahead

- this is really for drawing stuff and not the web
- 2 examples I found:
- left - compare each frame vs. right - compare each frame
- which one is the smoother one? (forget when it changes to colour)
- when it changes colour it's smooth, before that it's jerky
- straight ahead = left; pose to pose = right

# Review 5. follow through and overlapping

- there could be more than one principle (so arcing kind of yes)
- left example, long hair that's still going due to inertia

# Review 6. Ease in and ease out

- why this is important, when it comes to actual coding in CSS, you have a choice - linear = lifeless
- ease in/out is better because nothing is ever linear in life

# Review 7. Arcs

- look at Mickey's arms

# Review 8. Secondary Action

- so in animation, what do you think is the secondary action that reinforces the dog lying on his back?
- tail and back legs

# Review 9. Timing

- think of websites that use timing, if you click on something, and something pops up real fast/slow in a bouncing fashion

# Review 10. Exaggeration

- animation: draw dropping (not real life, but gives audience what this character is thinking)

# Review 11. Solid drawings

- animation: you can tell this character has weight, volume solidity...

# Review 12. Appeal

- animation: it's delightful to look at that character

# Val quote: Not all 12 principles apply...

- click link to article
- hovering buttons: one has a decaying bounce
- read: "that animation needs to pop more" vs "that follow-thru needs to be toned down"
- notice she's using the actual vocabulary

# Break

# Nabors quote:

- Rachel = another guru

# Stateful transitions - like breadcrumbs

- fluevog.com - notice you don't need to see the rest of the webpage anymore because the focus is on the search results
- context shift was nice/smooth - your mind is not cognitively putting effort to the background

# Supplmental Animation

- good.is/features - notice upon hovering each article title, subtitle appears underneath
- developer thought: maybe user would like some more info before clicking on it, so I will give that to you
- isn't that nice? thinking of the user = UX experience
- click on any article - 2 animations: progress bar, and further down social media sharing
- rather than showing sharing links at the bottom of article, web designer thought, well if reader has gone this far, I'll give you a nice-to-have, you may want to share this
- that is an example of supplmental animation - you didn't have to do that

# 3rd: Causal effects

- codepen: what principle of animation is that? anticipation
- it goes in the direction of my hover
- you are the causal effect of this change; it's giving you an indication of what's it's about to do if I click it
- peacock: imagine how you'd do this before animation existed on the web, using just forms/radio buttons/submit button - how would you do this quiz? UX experience?

# 4th: Decorative animation

- this is where you have to be careful as a web designer, you don't want to do something just because
- counter example is xbox one - if you can justify it then do it
- backstory: when the xbox one first arrived, how to compete with other reviews with photos, how to make it viral
- stumbled upon svg animation - became centerpiece causing it to be viral
