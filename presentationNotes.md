- subtle vs overanimate
- delightful experience but don't overdo it
- Val asks herself 3 questions before she decides to animate.
- 1st Q: does it tell the user info/something? Hey you're about to do something. If you hover over a button?
- 2nd Q: if you are hovering over button, you are the cause of that change
- 3rd Q: should be response of delight and not frustration

- the animation is offering the user no context shifting - your brain doesnt have to work hard to cognitively to put in the effort to figure out what happened. Imagine if there was no animation, your brain would have to figure out what happened -- but that's what you want to avoid. UX has to be smooth.

# Peer rev

- MS Windows didn't care for it / hushed - didn't want to put in the effort for animation on Win platform vs. Apple did
- now Apple more dominant - success due to iPhone
